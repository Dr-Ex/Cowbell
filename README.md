<h1>How to run this damn thing</h1>
So basically it runs by running the batch file inside the Frontend folder and if it doesn't give any errors you can get to it by going to http://localhost:5000.

If that doesn't work however, you'll need to install some python dependencies...
<ul>
<li>Flask</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub">Pydub</a></li>
</ul>

If all goes well, you should see the site! All code we're working towards is located inside the Frontend folder, the Backend_Experimentation is just for Hamish to try out some of his wizardry magic.
