# Cowbell
A flask based website for the generation of basic songs

## How to run this damn thing
So basically it runs by running the batch file inside the Frontend folder and if it doesn't give any errors you can get to it by going to http://localhost:5000.

## Dependencies

* Flask
* [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
* [FFmpeg] (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) or [Libav] (https://www.libav.org/) (These allow pydub to make non-wav files)

If all goes well, you should see the site! All code we're working towards is located inside the Frontend folder, the Backend_Experimentation is just for us to test and build features before adding them to the main website.
